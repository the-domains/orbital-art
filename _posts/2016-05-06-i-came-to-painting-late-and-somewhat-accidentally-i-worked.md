Orbital Art is a style of dynamic abstract art that utilises a patent pending brush technique to create an infinite array of unique spiralling forms. The compositions compositions created are often reminiscent of the landscapes of the deep sea, the sky or the Galaxy, anywhere where we are no longer grounded by earth, and where the mind can wander and wonder freely.

I came to painting late and somewhat accidentally. I worked as an architect in London for almost 20 years before starting to paint in my early 40's. As an Architect I worked with Lord Norman Foster, with whom I was a partner for many years, and the late Dame Zaha Hadid.

I started to create what I now call Orbital Art, a technique of dynamic abstraction, quite by chance.

I wanted to paint a painting for my wife Anisa for her birthday. This was to be my first painting on canvas for 20 years. My wife is the founder of a cosmetic accessory company that makes amazing make-up brushes so I decided that using her brushes would make the painting more uniquely personal.

I had recently been tinkering with the idea that a spinning make-up brush or shaving brush could have usage in applying more quickly or vigorously make up, skin care or shaving foam. My experiments had mixed results and left various substances splattered across bathroom walls.

With no idea what to paint I decided to see what happened if I instead used a make-up brush spinning in an power drill to apply the paint to the canvas. The results were surprising and very exciting. Rather than paint flying everywhere, if careful the paint formed tight circles and spirals similar to fossil and shell patterns. The resulting art had a very special energy. Somehow, using a delicate brush and powerful drill, helped to create something that is calm yet dynamic, powerful yet subtle, a kind of yin yang of masculine and feminine energy.

Anisa loved her birthday present and since then I have created hundreds of Orbital Art paintings and am patenting the technique.

By utilising a variety of different cosmetic brushes, from eye brushes to foundation brushes, and adjusting the torque of the drill and motion of the brush, an infinite variety of orbital forms can be created, each as unique as a fingerprint.
